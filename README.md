1984-2023 State Income Data (H-8)
1984-2018 State Income Data
2000-2024 Household Values

Introduction
In the past 20 years, housing in Boston has been increasing at a very significant rate. While on the housing search, we wondered what the factors causing such high rates in Boston are. We saw these high rates, and wanted to know why they are occuring, while looking for housing as upperclassmen at Northeastern University. We are also all interested in a career in finance, so we wanted to find correlation between household income and housing prices. To tackle this problem, we first used data from The Boston Foundation to focus specifically on housing pricing data within Boston, and more specifically, towns within Boston. This proved to be inefficient and not strong enough. The dataset seemed to have irrelevant data categories, and an insufficient number of years for regression, with data only dating back to 2020 and 2016. A lot of the data also had no use to us, so it was best to find different data. 
	We then shifted our efforts to a Zillow dataset. This file contains multiple dates a year of data since 2000 for every state, and includes median home price per state per month for that given state in that given time period. This data is reliable, as Zillow is one of the top housing information websites, with accurate and robust data. Since these numbers were very broad, averaging and pulling medians from whole states, there aren’t any specific privacy concerns associated with this data. In addition, since this data contains objective historical prices, there is no bias included. Our only concern was that there wasn't a ton of data for certain states, but we worked with it, as it was still enough. 
	To create a regression model, having factors that correlate to these median home prices per state is important to most accurately see if there are possible factors correlated to the significant rise in prices. We wanted to see if household income is a factor. To do this, we found income data from the United States Census. This is one of the most reliable data sources, which is why we pulled and used our data from there. There is not any prevalent potential bias, as the Census data is objective. There are also no major ethical concerns, because similar to the Zillow dataset, this dataset is representative of whole states. It does not exploit any privacy, and is very broad and general. This data has household income data, pulled all the way from 1984, giving us enough years to create an accurate regression line. One of the datasets was taken from a census spanning from 1984-2018, and the other from 1984-2023. This dataset contains median income, as well as the standard error for each state per year, serving as a strong and very useful dataset to start our analysis. 
Data Science Approaches:
	Within our approach, we cleaned our data, which is a critical part of our analysis. Although we encountered challenges in our datasets, we wanted to ensure reliability and accuracy before we began our analysis. To ensure we used clean and transformed data, we preserved data integrity while following key principles. We removed columns with parentheses in their names, dropped columns containing 'nan' values, and converted numeric columns to the appropriate data types. This ensured that the data was clean and ready for analysis.This ensured that we had our clean data using Pandas functions to clean. 
	For our primary Data Science Usage, we performed the primary modeling technique used in statistics throughout the project through both income forecasting and analysis in housing pricing trends. Income forecasting helps us accurately predict household trends over time for specific states when it comes to income. Housing trends helped model home values across different states and how they've changed. This Linear Regression Technique helped us understand the relationship between time and income/home values, which allowed for predictive modeling. We used linear regression to predict future household income based on historical data. This involved fitting a linear model to the data and using it to forecast future values.
	We also used Correlation Analysis, which quantifies the relationship between two variables. In this case, the correlation coefficient between median household income and median home values in each state. This depicted how strongly income and home values are related in different states, generating insights to patterns between these variables. We computed the correlation between median household income and median home values for each state. This helped identify how closely these two variables are related. We plotted our residuals, as a residual plot is very important in showing the differences between observed values and predicted values through the regression model. We did this for each state to make sure we weren't running into any problems with regression. A limitation in this residual analysis was that higher correlations among states had more of a pattern-like distribution, suggesting the linear regression model may not be fully capturing all of the factors/dynamics in household income data for these states. However, states with low correlation coefficients had effectively randomly distributed regression points, so we carried on with our analysis.


Time series analysis also applied in our analysis, helping us the trends in changes over time in housing markets in different states, as we compared different values over different time periods. We aggregated Zillow monthly data into yearly averages to observe trends over time. This helped in understanding the temporal dynamics of home values.
To better understand and break down all this analysis, we created dynamic line charts, and a heatmap. The line charts plotted the actual values and regression of our data, highlighting trends and comparisons, distinguishing our historical data points from our predictions. The heatmap’s color intensity provided visual understanding of these economic correlations. These visualizations made it easier to interpret the results and communicate findings.
Results and Conclusions:
As discussed earlier, regression line graphs were utilized to analyze housing trends and predict future costs for user-specified states. These graphs provided a framework for forecasting housing prices in upcoming years and allowed for a comparison of these predictions with actual historical prices. The comparisons revealed high accuracy in the regression models. Most states displayed a clear linear increase in housing costs, indicating consistent patterns across regions. However, a few outliers were identified, likely influenced by factors that were unique to the locations, such as local economic growth or legislative changes. These observations reinforced the importance of considering external variables in future analyses.

The next visualization that was made displayed housing value fluctuations over time and further illustrated an overall rapid increase. Within this increase, there were also very clear sudden peaks that can be held responsible by events that may have been happening during those specific time periods. For instance, a sharp rise in the early 2020s was likely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. This visualization also revealed distinct regional differences in growth rates. Urban states like California and New York exhibited more rapid increases in home values, reflecting their status as hubs for technology and business. In contrast, rural states showed slower growth rates, highlighting the impact of regional economic characteristics on housing trends.


Additionally, a correlation heatmap was created to assess the relationship between household income and home values. The heatmap revealed that over half of the states had correlation coefficients of 0.5 or higher, signifying a strong relationship between these variables. This finding underscores the critical role of housing costs as a driver of overall inflation, as changes in home values are closely tied to household economic conditions.

In conclusion, the results showcase both broad trends and detailed regional distinctions in housing market dynamics, emphasizing the need to account for diverse factors when analyzing or forecasting housing costs.
Future Work:
	The results of our project can lead to further efforts in predictive modeling. Developing more advanced machine learning models to forecast economic trends would be a strong way of advancing this analysis. Including more variables that could affect these rising housing prices like unemployment rates, education levels, and demographic changes could also prove to correlate highly with household income and home values. In addition to this, expanding more on the effect of massive firms increasing the price of land by looking into if this has been prevalent enough to raise median housing values should also be looked into. Looking into geographical data can also further explore this topic through looking into Urban vs. Rural comparisons and county level data. This could lead itself into policy changes in real estate investments, providing for a positive impact on the economic state of the country when it comes to the housing market.
